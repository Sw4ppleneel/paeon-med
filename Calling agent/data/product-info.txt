PRODUCT: NEXAVIR (azetromycin phosphate) — Injection, 50 mg/mL
Marketed by: Zenith BioTherapeutics, Inc.
================================================================

APPROVED INDICATION
-------------------
Nexavir is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults who have had an inadequate
response or intolerance to one or more conventional disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

MECHANISM OF ACTION
-------------------
Azetromycin phosphate is a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
inhibitor. It works by blocking the JAK1-mediated signaling
pathway, which reduces the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines including IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23. By targeting JAK1
selectively, Nexavir reduces systemic inflammation while
minimizing effects on JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 pathways.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
-------------------------
• Recommended dose: 50 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly.
• Nexavir is supplied as a pre-filled syringe (50 mg/mL).
• Can be administered by the patient at home after training.
• If a dose is missed, administer as soon as possible within
  3 days of the missed dose, then resume regular schedule.
• Do not administer two doses within 3 days of each other.

CLINICAL TRIAL DATA (NEXAVIR-RA1)
----------------------------------
Trial design: Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 52-week study in 1,200 adults with moderate-to-
severe RA.

Primary endpoint: ACR20 response at Week 24.
  • Nexavir 50 mg: 68% achieved ACR20 (p < 0.001 vs placebo)
  • Placebo: 32% achieved ACR20

Key secondary endpoints at Week 24:
  • ACR50: Nexavir 45% vs Placebo 15%
  • ACR70: Nexavir 22% vs Placebo 5%
  • DAS28-CRP < 2.6 (remission): Nexavir 28% vs Placebo 6%
  • HAQ-DI improvement ≥ 0.22: Nexavir 62% vs Placebo 33%

DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
------------------------------------
• Compared to non-selective JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib):
  Nexavir's selective JAK1 inhibition may result in a more
  favorable safety profile regarding hematologic effects.
• Compared to biologic DMARDs (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept):
  Nexavir is administered subcutaneously once weekly (vs
  biweekly or monthly for some biologics) and does not require
  cold-chain storage.
• Compared to methotrexate: Nexavir demonstrated superiority
  as monotherapy in ACR20 response in the NEXAVIR-RA1 trial
  subgroup analysis (62% vs 48%, p = 0.01).
• Oral JAK inhibitors require daily dosing; Nexavir is once
  weekly subcutaneous.

SAFETY — IMPORTANT WARNINGS
----------------------------
• Serious infections: Increased risk of serious infections
  including tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, and
  opportunistic infections. Do not initiate during active
  serious infection. Screen for TB before starting.
• Malignancy: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been
  observed. Consider risks vs benefits.
• Thrombosis: Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
  have been reported. Use with caution in patients with
  thrombosis risk factors.
• Laboratory monitoring: Check CBC, liver enzymes, and lipid
  profile at baseline and periodically during treatment.
  Interrupt treatment if ANC < 1000 cells/mm³ or ALC < 500
  cells/mm³.
• Hepatic effects: ALT/AST elevations reported. Not
  recommended in severe hepatic impairment.

COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS (≥ 5% in clinical trials)
---------------------------------------------------
Upper respiratory tract infections (12%), headache (8%),
nausea (7%), injection site reactions (6%), elevated
cholesterol (5%).

CONTRAINDICATIONS
-----------------
• Known hypersensitivity to azetromycin phosphate or any
  excipient.
• Active serious infection.
• Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

DRUG INTERACTIONS
-----------------
• Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): may increase
  azetromycin exposure; dose adjustment not required but
  monitor closely.
• Avoid concomitant use with other JAK inhibitors or biologic
  DMARDs.
• May be used concomitantly with methotrexate or conventional
  DMARDs.
• Live vaccines: avoid during treatment. Update vaccinations
  before initiating Nexavir.
