PRODUCT: ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM — Oral Tablet, 10 mg / 20 mg / 40 mg / 80 mg
Marketed by: Multiple Manufacturers (e.g., Pfizer Inc. for Lipitor®)
APPROVED INDICATION
Atorvastatin calcium is indicated as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle modification for:
• Reduction of elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, or familial hypercholesterolemia.
• Reduction of elevated triglycerides in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.
• Treatment of dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III).
• Reduction of the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, and coronary revascularization procedures in adults with established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme results in decreased intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis and increased expression of LDL receptors on hepatocytes, thereby enhancing clearance of circulating LDL-C. Atorvastatin also reduces VLDL production and modestly increases HDL-C levels.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
• Initial dose: 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily.
• Recommended starting dose for patients requiring >45% LDL-C reduction: 40 mg once daily.
• Maximum dose: 80 mg once daily.
• May be administered at any time of day, with or without food.
• Lipid levels should be assessed 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment.
• Dosage should be individualized based on baseline LDL-C, treatment goals, and patient response.
CLINICAL TRIAL DATA
Across multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials:
• LDL-C reduction ranged from approximately 39% (10 mg) to 60% (80 mg).
• Triglycerides were reduced by 19–37%.
• HDL-C increased by 5–9%.
In cardiovascular outcomes trials, atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction and stroke, compared to placebo or standard therapy.
DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
• Greater LDL-C lowering potency compared to simvastatin and pravastatin at equivalent doses.
• Proven cardiovascular outcomes data across both primary and secondary prevention populations.
• Flexible dosing without regard to time of administration.
• Extensive real-world safety and efficacy data.
SAFETY — IMPORTANT WARNINGS
• Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: Risk increases with higher doses and concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Discontinue if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) or suspected myopathy occurs.
• Hepatic dysfunction: Persistent elevations in serum transaminases have been reported. Liver function tests should be performed before initiation and as clinically indicated thereafter.
• Diabetes mellitus: Small increased risk of new-onset diabetes has been reported with statin therapy.
• Use in pregnancy: Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients.
COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS (≥ 2%)
Myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, nasopharyngitis, elevated liver enzymes.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
• Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases.
• Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Marketed by: Multiple Manufacturers
APPROVED INDICATION
Levothyroxine sodium is indicated for:
• Replacement or supplemental therapy in patients with hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism of the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.
• Suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer.
• Treatment of congenital or acquired hypothyroidism in pediatric and adult populations.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), a naturally occurring thyroid hormone. Following oral administration, levothyroxine is converted in peripheral tissues to triiodothyronine (T3), the biologically active hormone. Thyroid hormones regulate gene expression involved in cellular metabolism, oxygen consumption, protein synthesis, and normal growth and development.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
• Dosage is individualized based on age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and serum TSH levels.
• Typical full replacement dose in otherwise healthy adults: approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day.
• Lower initial doses (12.5–25 mcg/day) are recommended in elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease.
• Administer orally once daily on an empty stomach, preferably 30–60 minutes before breakfast.
• TSH levels should be monitored every 6–8 weeks after initiation or dosage adjustment.
• Lifelong therapy is generally required.
CLINICAL TRIAL DATA
Clinical studies and long-term observational data demonstrate:
• Normalisation of serum TSH and free T4 levels in the majority of patients.
• Improvement in hypothyroid symptoms including fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, and cognitive slowing.
• Effective suppression of TSH in thyroid cancer patients, reducing recurrence risk when appropriately dosed.
DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
• Considered the standard of care for thyroid hormone replacement.
• Predictable pharmacokinetics with consistent daily dosing.
• Preferred to combination T3/T4 therapy in most patients due to stable serum hormone levels.
• Extensive clinical experience across all age groups, including pregnancy.
SAFETY — IMPORTANT WARNINGS
• Not indicated for the treatment of obesity or weight loss; doses within the normal hormonal range are ineffective for this purpose, and higher doses may cause serious toxicity.
• Over-replacement may precipitate angina, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or osteoporosis.
• Use caution in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

PRODUCT: LOSARTAN POTASSIUM — Oral Tablet, 25 mg / 50 mg / 100 mg
Marketed by: Multiple Manufacturers
APPROVED INDICATION
Losartan potassium is indicated for:
• Treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients ≥6 years of age, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 • Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
 • Treatment of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, with elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that selectively inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to the AT₁ receptor in vascular smooth muscle and adrenal gland tissues. This blockade prevents vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, leading to decreased blood pressure, reduced sodium and water retention, and improved renal hemodynamics. Unlike ACE inhibitors, losartan does not inhibit bradykinin breakdown.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Hypertension:
 • Initial dose: 50 mg orally once daily.
 • Maximum dose: 100 mg daily, administered once or in divided doses.
 • Lower starting dose (25 mg) recommended for patients with volume depletion or hepatic impairment.
Diabetic Nephropathy:
 • Typical dose: 50 mg once daily, titrated to 100 mg once daily as tolerated.
Stroke Risk Reduction:
 • Start 50 mg once daily; may increase to 100 mg once daily based on blood pressure response.
• May be administered with or without food.
 • Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored periodically.
CLINICAL TRIAL DATA
• Demonstrated significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo.
 • In patients with diabetic nephropathy, losartan reduced progression to end-stage renal disease and decreased proteinuria.
 • Reduced incidence of stroke in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.
DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
• Comparable antihypertensive efficacy to ACE inhibitors with lower incidence of cough and angioedema.
 • Renoprotective benefits in diabetic patients independent of blood pressure reduction.

PRODUCT: GABAPENTIN (NEURONTIN®) — Oral Capsule/Tablets/Solution,
100 mg / 300 mg / 400 mg / 600 mg / 800 mg
Marketed by: Pfizer Inc. (Neurontin®); Generic Manufacturers
APPROVED INDICATION
Gabapentin is indicated for:
• Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and pediatric patients ≥3 years of age.
 • Management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults.
(Note: Gabapentin is widely used off-label for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and other chronic pain syndromes.)
MECHANISM OF ACTION
Gabapentin is a structural analogue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); however, it does not bind directly to GABA receptors. Gabapentin binds with high affinity to the α₂δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing calcium influx and decreasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P. This results in anticonvulsant and analgesic effects.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Postherpetic Neuralgia:
 • Day 1: 300 mg once daily
 • Day 2: 300 mg twice daily
 • Day 3: 300 mg three times daily
 • Maintenance dose: 900–1,800 mg/day in divided doses
 • Maximum dose: 3,600 mg/day
Partial Seizures:
 • Initial dose: 300 mg three times daily
 • Maintenance dose: 900–1,800 mg/day in divided doses
Administration Considerations:
 • Adjust dose in patients with renal impairment.
 • Do not abruptly discontinue; taper gradually over at least 1 week.
 • May be administered with or without food.
CLINICAL TRIAL DATA
• In postherpetic neuralgia trials, gabapentin significantly reduced pain scores compared with placebo.
 • In epilepsy studies, gabapentin reduced seizure frequency when used as adjunctive therapy.
 • Dose-response relationship observed up to 3,600 mg/day.
DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
• Non-opioid option for neuropathic pain.

PRODUCT: NEXAVIR (azetromycin phosphate) — Injection, 50 mg/mL
Marketed by: Zenith BioTherapeutics, Inc.
================================================================

APPROVED INDICATION
-------------------
Nexavir is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults who have had an inadequate
response or intolerance to one or more conventional disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

MECHANISM OF ACTION
-------------------
Azetromycin phosphate is a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
inhibitor. It works by blocking the JAK1-mediated signaling
pathway, which reduces the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines including IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23. By targeting JAK1
selectively, Nexavir reduces systemic inflammation while
minimizing effects on JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 pathways.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
-------------------------
• Recommended dose: 50 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly.
• Nexavir is supplied as a pre-filled syringe (50 mg/mL).
• Can be administered by the patient at home after training.
• If a dose is missed, administer as soon as possible within
  3 days of the missed dose, then resume regular schedule.
• Do not administer two doses within 3 days of each other.

CLINICAL TRIAL DATA (NEXAVIR-RA1)
----------------------------------
Trial design: Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, 52-week study in 1,200 adults with moderate-to-
severe RA.

Primary endpoint: ACR20 response at Week 24.
  • Nexavir 50 mg: 68% achieved ACR20 (p < 0.001 vs placebo)
  • Placebo: 32% achieved ACR20

Key secondary endpoints at Week 24:
  • ACR50: Nexavir 45% vs Placebo 15%
  • ACR70: Nexavir 22% vs Placebo 5%
  • DAS28-CRP < 2.6 (remission): Nexavir 28% vs Placebo 6%
  • HAQ-DI improvement ≥ 0.22: Nexavir 62% vs Placebo 33%

DIFFERENTIATION vs OTHER THERAPIES
------------------------------------
• Compared to non-selective JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib):
  Nexavir's selective JAK1 inhibition may result in a more
  favorable safety profile regarding hematologic effects.
• Compared to biologic DMARDs (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept):
  Nexavir is administered subcutaneously once weekly (vs
  biweekly or monthly for some biologics) and does not require
  cold-chain storage.
• Compared to methotrexate: Nexavir demonstrated superiority
  as monotherapy in ACR20 response in the NEXAVIR-RA1 trial
  subgroup analysis (62% vs 48%, p = 0.01).
• Oral JAK inhibitors require daily dosing; Nexavir is once
  weekly subcutaneous.

SAFETY — IMPORTANT WARNINGS
----------------------------
• Serious infections: Increased risk of serious infections
  including tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, and
  opportunistic infections. Do not initiate during active
  serious infection. Screen for TB before starting.
• Malignancy: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been
  observed. Consider risks vs benefits.
• Thrombosis: Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
  have been reported. Use with caution in patients with
  thrombosis risk factors.
• Laboratory monitoring: Check CBC, liver enzymes, and lipid
  profile at baseline and periodically during treatment.
  Interrupt treatment if ANC < 1000 cells/mm³ or ALC < 500
  cells/mm³.
• Hepatic effects: ALT/AST elevations reported. Not
  recommended in severe hepatic impairment.

COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS (≥ 5% in clinical trials)
---------------------------------------------------
Upper respiratory tract infections (12%), headache (8%),
nausea (7%), injection site reactions (6%), elevated
cholesterol (5%).

CONTRAINDICATIONS
-----------------
• Known hypersensitivity to azetromycin phosphate or any
  excipient.
• Active serious infection.
• Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

DRUG INTERACTIONS
-----------------
• Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): may increase
  azetromycin exposure; dose adjustment not required but
  monitor closely.
• Avoid concomitant use with other JAK inhibitors or biologic
  DMARDs.
• May be used concomitantly with methotrexate or conventional
  DMARDs.
• Live vaccines: avoid during treatment. Update vaccinations
  before initiating Nexavir.

STORAGE
-------
Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze.
Protect from light. Once removed from refrigeration, may be
kept at room temperature (up to 25°C / 77°F) for up to 14 days.
